# phone-harness install

phone-harness drives a real phone from a Mac: an **iPhone** through the macOS
iPhone Mirroring app, or an **Android** over adb (USB or Wi‑Fi). Same helpers
either way; you choose a default and can switch per call.

## Common

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShawnPana/phone-harness ~/.phone-harness   # canonical home
cd ~/.phone-harness
pip install -e .                      # the global `phone-harness` command (pulls pyobjc)

# register as an agent skill so Claude Code / Codex reach for it automatically
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/phone-harness
phone-harness skill > ~/.claude/skills/phone-harness/SKILL.md
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/phone-harness"
phone-harness skill > "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/phone-harness/SKILL.md"
```

- Python 3.10+. Only the CLI? `pip install phone-harness` works too; the
  checkout is what makes the harness editable (`agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py`).
- The default phone is `phone-harness config set platform ios|android`;
  `phone-harness config` shows every setting and where it came from;
  `PHONE_HARNESS_PLATFORM=android phone-harness …` overrides for one call.
- `phone-harness --doctor` checks the default phone; `--doctor ios` or
  `--doctor android` checks the other.

Re-run the `phone-harness skill > …/SKILL.md` lines after pulling updates so
the agent's copy matches the code.

## iPhone

- macOS Sequoia+ with **iPhone Mirroring** paired to the phone (open the app
  once and finish its pairing prompts — this needs the physical phone).
- Two permissions for your **terminal**, in System Settings → Privacy & Security:
  - **Accessibility** — taps and keystrokes. Takes effect immediately.
  - **Screen Recording** — seeing the phone. Takes effect after the terminal
    restarts.
  ```bash
  open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Accessibility"
  open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ScreenCapture"
  ```
- Then `phone-harness --doctor ios`.

> You may need to grant more than these two. They are the permissions we
> *know* are required and all `--doctor` checks; a fresh machine may prompt for
> more the first time an action runs. If `--doctor` passes but taps, typing, or
> capture silently do nothing, look for a macOS permission prompt.

## Android

- `brew install android-platform-tools` (adb). Optional: `brew install scrcpy`
  for a live mirror window during `phone-harness android awake`.
- On the phone, once: Settings → About phone → tap **Build number** 7× →
  Settings → System → **Developer options**.
- **USB**: Developer options → **USB debugging** on → plug in → tap **Allow**
  (tick "Always allow from this computer"). Done.
- **Wi‑Fi** (Android 11+, same network as the Mac): Developer options →
  **Wireless debugging** on → tap the row → **Pair device with pairing code** →
  `phone-harness android pair 123456` with the code shown. The phone is
  remembered by name; from then on the harness finds and connects it itself.
- `phone-harness config set platform android` to make it the default, then
  `phone-harness --doctor android`.
- `phone-harness android` shows known phones and what is attached; a plugged-in
  phone always wins over Wi‑Fi. Long task? `phone-harness android awake --bg`
  keeps the phone unlocked for the session without changing any setting;
  `phone-harness android rest` ends it.

## Both

Set up each as above; `phone-harness config set platform …` picks the default,
`PHONE_HARNESS_PLATFORM=…` picks per call. The two never interfere — the
iPhone is driven through the mirroring window, the Android over adb.

## If It Fails

`--doctor` walks the ladder in order and names the missing step. Common ones:

- **iPhone — capture is blank/black**: Screen Recording granted but the
  terminal wasn't restarted; or Mirroring shows an interstitial (iPhone in Use /
  Connect / Mac Locked) — clear it on the Mac, lock the iPhone if it says in use.
- **iPhone — taps do nothing**: Accessibility missing, or another window stole
  focus (helpers re-activate the window; check for a macOS prompt).
- **iPhone — `--doctor` says pyobjc missing on an install that works**: it is
  running a different Python than the one that has pyobjc; use the interpreter
  `pip install -e .` used, or `pip install pyobjc-framework-Quartz
  pyobjc-framework-Vision pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` for that one.
- **Android — `unauthorized`**: unlock the phone and tap Allow on the "Allow
  USB debugging?" prompt (replug if it does not appear).
- **Android — `no-device`**: USB debugging off, cable/port, or for Wi‑Fi:
  Wireless debugging turned itself off (it does after a reboot) or a different
  network than the Mac. `adb devices` shows what adb sees.
- **Android — `locked`**: unlock the phone; `phone-harness android awake` keeps
  it awake for the session. The harness never types a PIN.
- **Android — the tree is unavailable on some screen**: that screen never goes
  idle (something animates), so `uiautomator` refuses; read `screenshot()`
  instead or move to a screen that settles.
